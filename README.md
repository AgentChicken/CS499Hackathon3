The machine learning portion of the program uses scikit-learn's linear regression tool to process all four entries and their relationships with traffic. Because traffic doesn't change linearly throughout the day, the input data is preprocessed using scikit's polynomial features. As such, the data is, in effect, being fitted to a polynomial (more specifically, a polynomial of degree 6), not a straight line.
